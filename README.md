Dynamic MO Loader
=================

Changing the WordPress site language to any other than English slows down page generation times. A lot. This is caused by the slow and inefficient way of text domain loading. This plugin, based on the excellent work by Bj√∂rn Ahrens, aims to fix that by loading only the text domains that are used in a page and even more, by caching them.

PO and MO files are designed to be used with PHP Gettext-extension. But since it's an extension, it's not installed by defalt on very hosting platform. To overcome this barrier, WordPress has re-implemented the whole MO file parsing in PHP completely ignoring the possibility to use native gettext, if available. This WordPress' implementation is a bit slow.

This plugin has another implementation of MO parsing, which is faster than the default one. The plugin also loads only the text domains that are required to generate the current page instead the default behaviour of loading every available text domain. As front end pages usually only use strings from few text domains, this leads to a great perfomance boost in front end.

To boost the performance even more, the plugin also caches the loaded text domains in to the object cache. For optimal performance you need a fast object cache backend like Redis, Memcached or APC(u).

## Numbers

These following experiments are conducted in a decent LEMP-server, using nginx, MariaDB, php-fpm and Redis. The server has an SSD. This is the actual page generation time, not the server response time.
